# Make an array of all possible heights with the tower number, i.e. if height of any tower is h then we will insert h+k in the array and h-k(we will insert h-k in the array only if h-k â‰¥ 0).
# Sort the array.
# Find the index upto which height of every tower is included from the starting. Initialise the answer to the difference between height at this index and starting index.
# Then with the help of two pointer technique increment the left pointer which was initially at 0 such that one of the tower is not included.
# Similarly increment right pointer to make all towers included and update the answer. Do this until end of the array.
